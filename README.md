qt-webengine-kiosk
===============

This is simple browser application written on Qt &amp; QtWebEngine, and is a dirty hackport of Sergey Dryabzhinsky's much more stable qt-webkit-kiosk. It requires Qt >= 5.4, as this is the first version to officially include qtwebengine.

Usualy runing in fullscreen mode, but supports maximized and fixed size window mode.

This browser uses only one application window. So, no popups, no plugins in separate processes, like Chrome do.

Supports several parameters via configuration file: proxy, user-agent, click sound.

Also hides printer dialog and uses default or defined printer.

TBA when I get some windows builds happening
